Licensee agrees to comply with and be subject to all terms, conditions, policies and procedures associated with the Program, including this License Agreement, the Requirements for Certification available here and the Use Guidelines available here (“Policies”). Licensee agrees that OSHWA shall have the right to revise the Program, the criteria for certification in the Program, and the Policies governing participation in the Program from time to time as OSHWA in its sole discretion deems appropriate. Licensee agrees to maintain current contact information and to provide OSHWA with updated contact information as necessary.</p><h2 id="2-term-of-agreementtermination">2. TERM OF AGREEMENT/TERMINATION.</h2><p>a. This Agreement shall not become binding unless and until it is accepted, fully executed, and returned to you via the email address provided above by OSHWA.</p><p>b. This Agreement shall continue and remain in effect until one calendar year (365 days) after it was first made effective. If Licensee is thereafter re-certified in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Program, this Agreement shall thereupon automatically be renewed for an additional one-year term, and which shall be conditioned upon Licensee’s continued status as an eligible and certified participant in the Program.</p><p>c. This Agreement shall immediately terminate upon Licensee’s withdrawal or removal from the Program for any reason.</p><p>d. Should OSHWA, in its sole discretion, determine to cancel the Program or any portion thereof, OSHWA may, but is not required to, terminate this Agreement by giving Licensee at least sixty (60) days written notice of its intention to terminate.</p><p>e. This Agreement may also be terminated by OSHWA by written notice to Licensee that there has been a material breach of Licensee’s representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in this Agreement. Failures of compliance with the Program that do not amount to a material breach will be managed according to the enforcement provisions in Section 5 below.</p><p>f.

Licensee shall not at any time do or suffer to be done any act or thing which, directly or indirectly, may modify, alter, dilute or misuse the Mark(s). The Mark(s) may not be used in any manner that, in the sole discretion of OSHWA: discredits OSHWA; is false or misleading; violates the rights of others; violates any law, regulation, or other public policy; or mischaracterizes the relationship between OSHWA and Licensee.</p><p>f.
