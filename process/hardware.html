This license will provide the specific permissions and information downstream users need to make, use, remix, and build upon your work.</p><p>Licensing hardware is more complicated than licensing software. <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/process/software.html">Software automatically receives copyright protection upon creation, which makes licensing relatively straightforward</a>. By contrast, hardware has more moving pieces to consider. Your hardware project will likely contain software, documentation or branding – each of which may be protected by a different category of intellectual property law.</p><p>There are three main intellectual property regimes that may offer some protection to your project: copyright, trademark, and patent law. However, these regimes may not necessarily protect every component of your hardware.</p><ul><li>Copyright law offers protection for “original works of authorship” which are “fixed in a tangible medium.” This means that original and creative elements of your product may be protected by copyright law. This does not include functional elements of your product.</li><li>Trademark law protects “source identifiers”, which may include any brand names, product names, logos, or even the design and packaging of your product (more on this later).</li><li>Patent law protects functional inventions that are “novel” and “nonobvious”, when the inventor applies for protection from the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office.</li></ul><p>To the extent that your hardware may be protected by one or more of these IP regimes, properly applying an open source hardware license to your project ensures that downstream users can use your product within the bounds of your license. These regimes will not protect every element of your hardware:</p><ul><li>Copyright: While certain hardware elements might be creative, the creativity is often constrained by functionality, which prevents most physical aspects of most hardware from being protected by copyright. For example, the way in which parts of a 3D printer’s extruder work together is governed by functional concerns. That means that it cannot be protected by copyright law.</li><li>Trademark: While trademark law may protect the names, logos, and other elements that signal who the producer of the product is, in most cases trademark law do not protect the physical object itself.</li><li>Patent: The requirement that functional inventions be “novel” and “nonobvious” are high legal bars that few inventions meet. Additionally, patents are very expensive to obtain and the process is quite complicated, usually requiring help from specialized lawyers. You must take affirmative steps to obtain patent protection for your hardware.</li></ul><p>Regardless of how and to what extent these various types of IP protections apply to your specific hardware, it is important to apply the appropriate open source license to each element of your project. Doing so will enable downstream users to legally utilize your work. The terms of the license will signal to users how you would like them to use your hardware.</p><p>It is important to keep in mind that your hardware may not be fully protected by all—or any—of these IP rights. That means that a hardware license may do little to prevent bad actors from simply recreating unprotected components of your hardware projects and using them for purposes you do not approve of. It also means that licenses that require users to make their contributions open may not be legally enforceable. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t license at all. It is best to think of hardware licenses as guiding tools for good actors, not ways to punish bad actors.</p></div></div></section><section class="page-section page-section--process slide-panel__wrapper--compact" data-nav-order="2" id="spectrum"><div class="row"><a class="checklist slide-panel__open-trigger" data-term="checklist"><span>Checklist</span> <i class="material-icons">list</i></a><div class="slide-panel__wrapper slide-panel__wrapper--checklist"><div class="slide-panel" data-direction="right" data-value="checklist"><div class="slide-panel__container slide-panel__container--checklist"><div class="row slide-panel__close"><a href="#" class="slide-panel__close-trigger"><i class="material-icons slide-close-checklist"></i></a></div><div class="slide-panel__content"><div class="slide-panel__checklist"><h4>Checklist</h4><p>Have you provided links to your original design files for your hardware on the product itself or its documentation?</p><p>Have you made it easy to find your original design files from the website for a product?</p><p>Have you clearly indicated which parts of a product are open-source (and which aren’t)?</p><p>Have you applied an open source license to your hardware?</p><p>After certification, remember to:</p><ul><li>Label your hardware with a version number or release date, so people can match the physical object with the corresponding version of its design files.</li><li>Use the OSHWA certification mark logo on your hardware.

As a result, at a baseline level, the hardware for many functional open source hardware products will not be protected at all. Copyright protection will begin to attach only as decorative and aesthetic elements are added to the hardware.</p><p>Whether a particular hardware design or design element is covered by copyright is not always a simple yes/no question. Instead, the range of copyright protectability of hardware tends to vary on a spectrum that is closely linked to the hardware’s functionality. The more the hardware’s design is driven by functional concerns, the less likely it will be protected by copyright; the less the hardware’s design is driven by functional concerns, the more likely it will be protected by copyright.</p><p>The spectrum below shows the range of protectability of various exemplary products. Hardware towards the left side of the spectrum is mostly or exclusively functional, meaning it receives little or no protection under copyright law. As you move across the spectrum, the hardware integrates an increasing number of non-functional, creative design elements, increasing the hardware’s protectability under copyright law. It’s important to keep in mind that this protection will never extend to any purely functional components of the hardware. However, in some cases—for example, when decorative or aesthetic features extend across the entire product, or when a decorative or aesthetic feature is essential to the product’s appeal to users, this protection can effectively control reproduction of the entire physical product.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column large-12"><div class="spectrum-container"><div class="row expanded"><div class="column"><p class="label">Less<br>Protectable</p></div><div class="column" style="text-align: right"><p class="label">More<br>Protectable</p></div></div><div id="spectrum-line"><div class="line"><div class="circle" id="circle1" circle-attr="1"></div><div class="circle" id="circle2" circle-attr="2"></div><div class="circle" id="circle3" circle-attr="3"></div><div class="circle" id="circle5" circle-attr="5"></div><div class="circle" id="circle6" circle-attr="6"></div><div class="circle" id="circle7" circle-attr="7"></div><div class="circle" id="circle9" circle-attr="9"></div><div class="circle" id="circle10" circle-attr="10"></div></div></div></div><div class="schematic-description" position-attr="1"><h4>Open Source Laboratory Sample Rotator and Mixer</h4><p>This product is a 3-D printable laboratory sample rotator-mixer designed for tumbling and gentle mixing of laboratory samples. This design easily allows for a variety of mixing angles and features a convenient angle changing mechanism.</p><p>The physical design choices that were made in constructing this product were driven almost exclusively by functional motivations. As a result, the hardware does not incorporate creative design elements that are unrelated to the core functionality of the product.

The requirements of those technical elements - not creative decisions by the team - define its physical appearance. As such, it is unlikely that the Chirmen’s physical hardware is protected by copyright. This lack of copyright protection for Chirmen’s hardware does not reduce the copyright protection that would apply to any software incorporated into the hardware.</p><div class="spectrum-image"><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/9mu5fp12mbct/7cBarIOwGAasuI0s0c2ccM/8f21614fe614d2e52ae9867ff0674a57/image27.png" alt="chirmen"></div></div><div class="schematic-description" position-attr="3"><h4>Neurobite</h4><p>The Neurobite’s physical layout is almost entirely dictated by the functional requirments of the PCB. However, the team has incorporated an image of a neuron and centered it on the LED. This arguably gives it a low level of copoyright protection, so it is wise for the team to include a permissive copyright license for the hardware.</p><div class="spectrum-image"><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/9mu5fp12mbct/6stlw6AFVYmUayeGoWUwKQ/10eed168e650560ecc1196d6bf66a011/image30.png" alt="neurobite"></div></div><div class="schematic-description" position-attr="5"><h4>ECG Patient Simulator</h4><p>This product tests the accuracy and performance of an Electrocardiogram (ECG) cable. The ECG Patient Simulator generates an ECG signal similar to that of a perfectly connected patient and is used to compare the strength of the signal before and after the cable is connected to the patient.</p><p>The physical design of this product is largely derived from the functional components of hardware. Nevertheless, there are some aesthetic design elements incorporated into the hardware that may warrant some copyright protection of those elements, such as the ECG wave in the center of the product, the bright orange color, and the distinctive color of each knob’s assigned letter.</p><div class="spectrum-image"><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/9mu5fp12mbct/46lS5buI2FCQ0yPIXAuyfu/5828396673b758ada2e1b06211674e7f/ecg.png" alt="ECG Patient Simulator"></div></div><div class="schematic-description" position-attr="6"><h4>AXIOM Case</h4><p>The shape and featureds of the axiom case are mostly dictated by the functional necessity of housing the core elements, providing ventilation, and connecting accesories. Nonetheless, the team has made creative decisions around how to shape the ventilation, as well as the contrast piece and notch on the side. This creates at least the potential that the case itself may have some level of copyright protection.</p><div class="spectrum-image"><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/9mu5fp12mbct/4IrJaR5rMkcA2auI4kA0wK/4b59c4dcff05ef8da700f8ce2ff295cd/image8.png" alt="axiom-internal-hardware"></div></div><div class="schematic-description" position-attr="7"><h4>Mycroft Mark 1</h4><p>The Mycroft Mark 1 incorporates functional elements such as status lights into a whimsical and decorative case that evokes the face of a friendly robot assistant.

The range of protectability of hardware varies on a spectrum, with some hardware projects that are very likely to be protected by copyright, some that are not, and others that are somewhere in the middle. Regardless of where your hardware project falls on this spectrum, it is still required to have an open source license, addressing any copyright and other intellectual property rights that cover your project, attached to the project in order to receive OSHWA certification.</p><p>With a properly defined open source license, you assure the public that your project is truly “open source” for others to use, distribute, and modify. The license guarantees downstream users the freedom to use and modify your work without needing additional permissions. It also tells downstream users exactly what they can and cannot do with your invention – while also giving you, the original creator, credit for your contributions!</p><p>There are several OSHWA-approved open licenses that you can choose from.
